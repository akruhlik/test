Can't step in my way
Head first into love and dismay
It's like beating the dead
I can't stop going out of my head
Whatever this could be I'd never know
I never said it'd be the end all to be all
I hate you today
I can't find a way
Don't drag me down now
Goodbye
I've had enough frustration
I won't get stuck
Goodbye
This dead end situation
It's just not worth my time
